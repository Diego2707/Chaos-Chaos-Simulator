#CHAOS CHAOS Simulator
---

THIS PROJECT IS NOT DONE YET!

I'm working on making a javascript version of the Jevil fight from the game Deltarune.
Currently, the game is in the very beginning stages. I'm working on adding basic functionality at the moment, so the project most liekly won't be fleshed out fully for a bit.

If you have any suggestions or ideas, please let me know, I would much appreciate any help you can give.
